I want to create a tkinter app that looks like the attached image, "Perth EUC Assets.jpg"

It will have 5 buttons, just like in the screenshot.
Their labels will be:
"Basement 4.2", "Build Room", a "Minus" symbol, a "Plus" symbol, and ."xlsx"

The "_" & "-" symbols have a text input field between them, that only accepts numbers.

There is a spreadsheet called "Perth EUC Assets.xlsx" in the same folder as the script.
This spreadsheet will contain the following sheets and column headers:

# Load the workbook or create it if it doesn't exist
workbook_path = 'EUC_Perth_Assets.xlsx'
if Path(workbook_path).exists():
    workbook = load_workbook(workbook_path)
else:
    workbook = Workbook()
    workbook.active.title = '4.2 Items'
    workbook.create_sheet('4.2 Timestamps')
    workbook.create_sheet('BR Items')
    workbook.create_sheet('BR Timestamps')
    workbook.create_sheet('Project Designated Items')
    workbook.create_sheet('Project Designated Timestamps')
    workbook.create_sheet('All SANs')
    workbook['4.2 Items'].append(["Item", "LastCount", "NewCount"])
    workbook['4.2 Timestamps'].append(["Timestamp", "Item", "Action", "SAN Number"])
    workbook['BR Items'].append(["Item", "LastCount", "NewCount"])
    workbook['BR Timestamps'].append(["Timestamp", "Item", "Action", "SAN Number"])
    workbook['Project Designated Items'].append(["Item", "LastCount", "NewCount"])
    workbook['Project Designated Timestamps'].append(["Timestamp", "Item", "Action", "SAN Number"])
    workbook['All SANs'].append(["Item", "SAN Number", "Timestamp"])
    workbook.save(workbook_path)


The tkinter window will have 2 "treeviews" - The top one will contain the data from the "4.2 Items" or "BR Items" sheets, depending on whether the button "Basement 4.2" or "Build Room" is active.

The "Basement 4.2" button is to be active by default at startup.
This button is linked to the 1st treeview displaying the contents of sheet1, "4.2 Items", and the 2nd treeview displaying the contents of the sheet "4.2 Timestamps"

If the "Build Room" button is selected/is active, then the 1st treeview will display the contents of sheet "BR Items", and the second treeview
