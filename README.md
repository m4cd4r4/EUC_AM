Convert the following info into step-by-step, complete instructions:

Using Tkinter Designer [Top]
Required Inputs
There are some inputs you'll need to collect to be able to use the TKinter Designer.


1. Personal Access Token
Log into your Figma account
Navigate to Settings
In the Account tab, scroll down to Personal access tokens
Enter the name of your access token in the entry form and press Enter
Your personal access token will be created.
Copy this token and keep it somewhere safe.
You will not get another chance to copy this token.

2. Getting your File URL
In your Figma design file, click the Share button in the top bar, then click on ðŸ”— Copy link

Using the CLI
Using the CLI is as simple as installing the package and running the CLI tool.

From PyPi
You can use the below command as test by replacing $FILE_URL & $FIGMA_TOKEN by your data. If you haven't got the token and link then refer to Required Inputs Section.

pip install tkdesigner

tkdesigner $FILE_URL $FIGMA_TOKEN
From Source
To use CLI from the source code you need to clone the repository and then follow the below instructions.

You can use the below command as test by replacing $FILE_URL & $FIGMA_TOKEN by your data. If you haven't got the token and link then refer to Required Inputs Section.

$ python -m tkdesigner.cli $FILE_URL $FIGMA_TOKEN

# To learn more about how to use the cli, pass the --help flag
$ python -m tkdesigner --help
Output
By default, the GUI code will be written to build/gui.py. You can specify the output path by using -o Flag and providing the path.

To run the generated GUI, cd into the directory you built it to (e.g. build/) and run it just as you would any Tkinter GUI.

cd build
python3 gui.py

Using the GUI
Open Tkinter Designer before doing the following steps

Open TKinter Designer GUI by
cd Tkinter-Designer
cd gui
python3 gui.py
Paste your personal access token into the Token ID form in Tkinter Designer
Paste the link into the File URL form in Tkinter Designer
Click the Output Path form to open a file browser
Choose an output path and click Select Folder
Press Generate
The output files from Tkinter Designer will be placed in your chosen directory, inside a new folder called build. Congratulations, you have now created your Tkinter GUI using Tkinter Designer!

Click on ðŸ”— Copy link to copy the file URL.
Step 2: Using the CLI
2.1 Installation from PyPi
Install Tkinter Designer using the command: pip install tkdesigner.
Run Tkinter Designer with your Figma file URL and personal access token: tkdesigner $FILE_URL $FIGMA_TOKEN. Replace $FILE_URL and $FIGMA_TOKEN with your data.
2.2 Installation from Source
Clone the Tkinter Designer repository.
Run Tkinter Designer using the command: python -m tkdesigner.cli $FILE_URL $FIGMA_TOKEN. Replace $FILE_URL and $FIGMA_TOKEN with your data.
For additional help, use: python -m tkdesigner --help.
2.3 Output
By default, the GUI code is written to build/gui.py.
To specify a different output path, use the -o flag followed by the desired path.

Step 3: Using the GUI
3.1 Setting Up Tkinter Designer GUI
Open the Tkinter Designer directory and navigate to the GUI folder:
bash
Copy code
cd Tkinter-Designer
cd gui
Run the Tkinter Designer GUI: python3 gui.py.
3.2 Generating the GUI
Paste your personal access token into the Token ID form in Tkinter Designer.
Paste the Figma file URL into the File URL form.
Click the Output Path form to open a file browser.
Choose an output path and click Select Folder.
Press Generate.
3.3 Output
The output files from Tkinter Designer will be placed in your chosen directory, inside a new folder called build.
Congratulations, you have now created your Tkinter GUI using Tkinter Designer!

In step 2.2-2, what would the $FILE_URL look like?
ChatGPT
In step 2.2-2, when using Tkinter Designer from the source, the $FILE_URL is the URL of your Figma design file. This URL is obtained from Figma and typically looks like this:

ruby
Copy code
https://www.figma.com/file/[FileID]/[FileName]?node-id=[NodeID]
Here's a breakdown of the components:

https://www.figma.com/file/: This is the standard prefix for all Figma file URLs.
[FileID]: This is a unique identifier for your Figma file. It's a string of letters and numbers.
[FileName]: The name of your Figma file. This part of the URL can sometimes be omitted.
?node-id=[NodeID]: An optional parameter specifying a particular node or frame within the Figma file. This part might not be necessary for Tkinter Designer, depending on what it requires.
When you replace $FILE_URL in the command python -m tkdesigner.cli $FILE_URL $FIGMA_TOKEN, you should substitute it with the actual URL of your Figma file. For example:

ruby
Copy code
python -m tkdesigner.cli https://www.figma.com/file/12345ABC/MyDesign?node-id=6789 $FIGMA_TOKEN
In this example, replace https://www.figma.com/file/12345ABC/MyDesign?node-id=6789 with your actual Figma file URL and $FIGMA_TOKEN with your personal access token.

Tkinter-Designer>python -m tkdesigner.cli 'https://www.figma.com/file/gqgSnw4EmjHqna70G8Imno/SAN?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PeAzfIHdltrs18nP-1' 'figd_ZGsxDwCSIgcqWVBOZ2WKgXelnqI40LaHZZE-OV7I'
usage: cli.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-f] file_url token
cli.py: error: the following arguments are required: token
'node-id' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Invalid parameter - =design
't' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
ChatGPT
The error you're encountering seems to be due to the way the Figma file URL is being parsed in the command line. The URL contains special characters like & and ?, which can be interpreted differently by the command line environment. To resolve this, you should enclose the entire URL in double quotes, not single quotes, and ensure there are no spaces around the equals sign in the command.

Here's how you should format the command:

bash
Copy code
python -m tkdesigner.cli "https://www.figma.com/file/gqgSnw4EmjHqna70G8Imno/SAN?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PeAzfIHdltrs18nP-1" "figd_ZGsxDwCSIgcqWVBOZ2WKgXelnqI40LaHZZE-OV7I"
This command encloses the URL and the token in double quotes, which should prevent the command line from misinterpreting special characters in the URL.
